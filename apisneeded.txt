On a standard post:
  - User's name
  - Question
  - Tags
  - Answers(comments)
  - Reply button

Create post page

On front page:
  - search bar on top
  - list or array of questions (think reddit) that are links to posts (see above^^)
    - on each item it will have user's name
    - question
    - number of comments/answers
    
Later:
  - Add pages based on tags
    - example: physics page or calculus page that only lists posts with those tags
  - Page listing tags
    - people may click on tag and then they view tags
