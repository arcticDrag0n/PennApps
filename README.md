# PennApps Project
HomeworkOverflow

This project's goal is to create a webapp that is for students to use get answers to questions for their classes.
It will be a student driven app where students both create posts and answer them.

The inspiration for this project was from doing physics homework and not finding many free sites (cough cough chegg.com) that answered the questions. Therefore we thought to create our own.

The webapp allows users to post, rate, answer questions, and all throught the ease of google sign-ins.

USED:
SQL, Angular 4, PHP, Bootstrap, Html, CSS, Google Cloud Services, Google Sign-in API
